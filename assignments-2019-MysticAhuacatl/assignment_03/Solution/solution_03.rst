3.1 Python data types (7 points)
================================

a) Float (float)
b) Integer (int)
c) Boolean (bool)
d) String (str)
e) List (list)
f) Tuple (tuple)
g) NoneType (NoneType)
h) Dictionary (dict)


3.2 Python Lists and Strings (20 points)
========================================

(Note: in the following the ``ipython`` prompts ``In[]`` and ``Out[]``
are shown to clearly indicate input and output.)

a) Slicing:

   .. code:: python

       In [3]: bag[1:3]
       Out[3]: ['towel', 'tea']

b) step -1 reverses the list:

   .. code:: python

       In [4]: bag[::-1]
       Out[4]: [42, 'tea', 'towel', 'guide']

   To get ``['tea', 'towel']``:

   .. code:: python
   
       In [6]: bag[2:0:-1]
       Out[6]: ['tea', 'towel']

   alternatively:

   .. code:: python

       In [7]: bag[-2:-4:-1]
       Out[7]: ['tea', 'towel']

c) String slicing:

   .. code:: python

         In [8]: ga[:4]
         Out[8]: 'Four'

         In [9]: ga[15:20]
         Out[9]: 'seven'
 
d)  list assignments

    i) ``bag[0] = book``  sets the first element of the list to
       the string "book".
 
    ii) Other lists:

        .. code:: python

           In [14]: bag
           Out[14]: ['book', 'towel', 'tea', 'mice']

           In [15]: mybag
           Out[15]: ['book', 'towel', 'tea', 'mice']

           In [16]: yourbag
           Out[16]: ['book', 'towel', 'tea', 42, 'money']
    

    iii) ``x = a`` makes ``x`` identical to ``a``. Any change in ``x`` is reflected in
         ``a``. (In C one would say, ``x`` points to the same address as ``a``.)
          
         ``y = a[:]`` makes a (shallow) copy of ``a`` and assigns it
         to ``y`` that is now independent from ``a``.

e) String manipulation

      i) assignment

         .. code:: python
      
            ga[:4] = "Three"

         raises a ``TypeError``: one cannot assign to parts of a
         string. This is how strings differ from lists.

      ii) string manipulation
      
          Create a new string

          .. code:: python

              In [21]: 'Three' + ga[4:]
              Out[21]: 'Three score and seven years ago'

          or use the string's replace() method:

          .. code:: python

             ga.replace("Four", "Three")

f) String methods
   
   Splits the string on whitespace:

   .. code:: python
   
        In [3]: ga.split()
        Out[3]: ['Four', 'score', 'and', 'seven', 'years', 'ago']

   Assign slice of the splitted list to individual variables (using
   tuple assignment):

   .. code:: python
   
        In [4]: a, b, c = ga.split()[:3]
        In [5]: print(a,b,c)
        ('Four', 'score', 'and')

   ``list()`` turns a list into a list (d'oh!):

   .. code:: python
   
        In [6]: list([1,2,3])
        Out[6]: [1, 2, 3]

   ``list()`` turns a string into a list of characters (aha!):

   .. code:: python
   
        In [7]: list(ga)
        Out[7]:
        ['F',
         'o',
         'u',
         'r',
         ' ',
         's',
         'c',
         'o',
         'r',
         'e',
         ' ',
         'a',
         'n',
         'd',
         ' ',
         's',
         'e',
         'v',
         'e',
         'n',
         ' ',
         'y',
         'e',
         'a',
         'r',
         's',
         ' ',
         'a',
         'g',
         'o']

   (The fact that the list is printed vertically instead of
   horizontally ``['F', 'o', 'u', ...]`` is not relevant and just
   depends on how ``python`` or ``ipython`` are configured to print
   variables to the screen.)

         
   **In summary:** Strings can be processed by ``split()`` (splits on
   white space by default) and the resulting list assigned to
   individual variables. The optional argument to ``split()`` can
   designate a different character to split on. Note that the default
   ``split(None)`` splits on *any* number of consecutive white space
   characters whereas ``split(" ")`` splits on *each* white space
   character so that :

   .. code:: python

       "  1 2 ".split() ==  ["1", "2"]
       "  1 2 ".split(" ") == ["", "", "1", "2", ""]

   Strings can be turned into a list of characters by using the
   list constructor ``list()``.


g) Nested list:

   .. code:: python
 
         In [23]: bags[0]
         Out[23]: ['salt', 'pepper']
 
         In [24]: bags[0][1]
         Out[24]: 'pepper'
 
         In [25]: bags[1][2]
         Out[25]: 'ruler'


3.3 Loops (14 points)
=====================

a)  .. code:: python
        
        sentence = ["We", "must", "walk", "before", "we", "can", "run"]

        for i in sentence:
            print(i)

b) BONUS: use the "step" argument for slicing a list ``sentence[start:stop:step]``:

   .. code:: python

        sentence = ["We", "must", "walk", "before", "we", "can", "run"]

        for i in sentence[::2]:
            print(i)


c) Solution 1: use the start and stop argument of ``range(start,
   stop)`` and remember that stop is *excluded* (so we need to use
   1001 for stop):

   .. code:: python

        total = 0
        for i in range(1, 1001):
            total += i

        print(total)


   Solution 2: Add 1 in the loop (but this is less clear than the
   Solution 1 above)

   .. code:: python

        result = 0
        for i in range(1000):
            result += i+1

        print(result)


   Solution 3: (hardcore solution - learn about "Python list
   comprehensions"):

   .. code:: python

        total = sum([i for i in range(1, 1001)])
        print(total)


   (Look up `"Python list comprehension"
   <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions>`_!)

d) Countdown with loops
   
   i) Canonical countdown

      .. code:: python

         counter = 10
         while counter > 0:
               print(counter)
               counter -= 1

   ii) Multiple solutions. First use all arguments of ``range()``:

       .. code:: python

           for i in range(10, 0, -1):
               print(i)

       Using arithmetic:

       .. code:: python

           for i in range(10):
               print(10-i)

   

3.4 Simple coordinate manipulation in Python (11 points)
========================================================

Complete solutions are provided in the files ``Solution/coordinates_{a,b,c,d}.py``.

a) see ``Solution/coordinates_a.py``:

   .. code:: python
             
      [1.34234, 1.34234, 0.0]

b) see ``Solution/coordinates_b.py``

   .. code:: python

      1.34234

c) see ``Solution/coordinates_c.py``; however, many different solutions are possible and some are
   listed here:

   Here we make a copy of the positions and then increment each element *in place* with
   ``new_position[i] += t[i]``:
   
   .. code:: python

      new_positions = []
      for position in positions:
          new_position = position[:]  # make a copy
          for i in range(3):
              new_position[i] += t[i]
          new_positions.append(new_position)
      print(new_positions)

   If you have something like the above or the solution in ``Solution/coordinates_c.py`` then you
   get all points.

   However, that is pretty ugly (and un-pythonic) code, and it has poor performance. The following
   are all better ways to do the same thing: try to understand them!

   This can be written more efficiently with `list comprehensions
   <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions>`_   

   .. code:: python
             
      new_positions = [[position[i] + t[i] for i in range(3)] 
                        for position in positions]

   Use of the ``zip()`` function can also help:

   .. code:: python

      new_positions = [[xi + ti for xi, ti in zip(position, t)] 
                       for position in positions]

   (We will see in the lesson on NumPy that nothing beats ``numpy`` in terms of clarity and speed, though.)
