2.1 Operators (6 points)
========================

a)
   Output::

     15.0 0.5 9765625.0 10.0

   The operations are addition, division, exponentiation, and
   remainder after division.

b)
   Error: ``ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero``

   Python is letting the user know that a division by zero
   occured. The reason is that ``y//x`` performs floor division and
   yields ``-1.0``, which then leads to the whole denominator being
   zero.
   

2.2 Very Simple Temperature Calculator (13 points)
==================================================

a) BONUS: The difference in Kelvin is

   .. math::

     \begin{split}
      \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 &= \\
           &=\left[\frac{5}{9}(\theta_2 - 32) + 273.15\right] -
           \left[\frac{5}{9}(\theta_1 - 32) + 273.15\right] = \\
           &= \frac{5}{9}(\theta_2 - \theta_1) = \frac{5}{9} \Delta\theta
     \end{split}

b) Sum of :math:`T` in K and :math:`\Delta\theta` in Fahrenheit

   .. math::

      T' = T + \frac{5}{9} \Delta\theta

   gives the total :math:`T'` in Kelvin.
      
     
c) Program ``addtemperatures.py``

   .. code:: python
     
     # HW02 2.2 addtemperatures.py
 
     T_K = float(input("Temperature in Kelvin --> "))
     theta_F = float(input("Temperature difference in Fahrenheit --> "))
 
     delta_T_K = 5/9 * theta_F
     T_total = T_K + delta_T_K

     print("Total T " + str(T_total) + " K")

d) Input and output::
     
     Temperature in Kelvin --> 265
     Temperature difference in Fahrenheit --> 63
     Total T 300.0 K

   (Correct sum is 300 K.)
   

2.3 Version control with Git (9 points)
=======================================

a) Briefly explain what a version control system such as Git does and how it can help you. (For
   your answer, it is sufficient to focus on three different aspects out of many --- choose the ones
   that you find most important.)

   1. A version control system keeps track of the whole history of changes to a set of files.
   2. It allows accessing any point in the history (like an undo).
   3. It also supports combining changes from different sources.

b) ``git init`` initializes an empty repository whereas ``git clone`` initializes an empty
   repository and then immediately fills it with the history from a "remote" repository.

c) ``git add`` adds a file or changes to a file to the staging area and marks it to be committed. ``git
   commit`` then takes the contents from the staging area and adds them to the repository
   history. (You need to commit to record what changed.)

d) ``git push`` inserts the local history into a remote history but does not add new history to the
   local repository (which is what ``git commit`` does).

Notes:

- ``jedi_locations.map`` is never under version control in this sequence.
- use ::

    git status

  to see files in the staging area ("new file" or "modified" in green).

  When you commit, note which files are created or removed.
- The Solution also contains an example file tree in the directory
  ``Documents``, which you can use for testing. However, it is not a
  good idea to create a git repository inside another git repository
  --- much confusion will ensue. Therefore, if you want to play with
  the ``Documents`` tree we suggest you do the following and create a
  temporary directory (assuming that you are located in the
  ``02/Solutions`` directory):

  .. code:: bash

    mkdir ~/tmp
    cp -r Documents ~/tmp
    cd ~/tmp/Documents
    git init
    git add shopping.txt
    git add planets/alderaan.jpg
    # ...

  When you are done, you can just (careful, we have to use ``rm
  -rf``!) remove the ``~/tmp/Documents`` directory again:

  .. code:: bash

    cd
    rm -rf ~/tmp/Documents

  This will remove the ``~/tmp/Documents`` directory including the git
  repository that you created inside it.
