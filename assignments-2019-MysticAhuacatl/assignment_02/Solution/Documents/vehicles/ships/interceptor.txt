The TIE/IN starfighter, simply known as TIE Interceptor or T/I[11],
was a TIE Series starfighter used by the Galactic Empire. The TIE
Interceptor was identifiable by its arrow-shaped solar collection
panels, a distinct difference from the hexagonal solar arrays of its
predecessor, the TIE Fighter. The Interceptor was one of the fastest
starfighters in the galaxy at its prime, nearly rivaling the
Alliance's RZ-1 A-wing interceptor.

Due to their speed, distinct shape, and narrow profile in comparison
to the TIE/ln starfighter (which was nicknamed "eyeball"), TIE
Interceptors came to be referred to occasionally as "squints" by enemy
pilots.[12]
