1.1 Commands and paths (8 points)
=================================

a) What is the function of the cd and the pwd command?

   - ``cd``    : change directory
   - ``pwd``   : print the present working directory

b) Show commands for two different ways to change to your home directory,
   assuming you are currently in the root directory.

   Possible solutions:

   - ``cd``
   - ``cd $HOME``
   - ``cd ~``
   - ``cd ~$USER``
   - ``cd /home/$USER``
   - ``cd home/$USER`` (works because you are in the root directory ``/``)
   - ``cd home/../home/../home/../home/../home/../home/$USER` (kind of a joke)     

c) Given the path ``/home/dvader/Documents/../data/bases``:

   i) Is this an absolute path or relative path?
   
      - Absolute

  ii) If you are located in the home directory of user dvader
      (``/home/dvader``) then what is the shortest path to bases?
      
      - ``data/bases``

d) If you were in a directory ``/home/dvader/data`` and you executed the
   command ``cd ./.././.././.``, what would be the output of running the
   pwd command afterwards? [1]_
    
       - ``/home``
       
.. [1] Sorry if you got confused by the comma in the question after
       the path... lesson: every little detail counts in Unix.

e) Describe two ways by which you could learn more about the function
   of a Unix command ``frbzz`` that you don't know anything about.

       1. **Manual page**: Looking for a man page entry for the command in question (``man frbzz``)
       2. **Help flags**: Try some typical flags for help (``frbzz -h``, ``frbzz --help``)
       3. **Search on the internet**: Google it... (do not
 	  underestimate how useful this is!)

f) BONUS (+4*)

   - Advantages
   
         - actions are not limited by the design of the user interface
         - fast (once you master it)
         - modular (chaining of many small, well-designed and
           powerful tools with pipes)
         - shell glob patterns and regular expressions make it easy to
           work with large numbers of files
         - scripts as libraries of solutions to recurring tasks
         - batch processing of large number of files
         - can be used remotely even over poor connections
         - small resource footprint (available on *anything*)
         - clearer picture of filesystem structure
         - You look flippin' awesome in starbucks [2]_
           
   - Disadvantages
   
         - steep learning curve (unintuitive)
         - unforgiving
         - It is "ugly" [2]_
         - Little mouse support
         - Little color support
         - no support for graphics or working with images
         - Coffee shop owners think you are a cyber terrorist (says Ian)

.. [2] This statement is "in the eye of the beholder..."


1.2 Copy, rename, delete (4 points)
===================================

Show the output of the commands::

  cd ~
  ls -R PHY494/01_shell
  
which will be compared against the expected directory structure and
content.

Expected output::
    
   |============================================================|
   |01_shell/:                                                  |
   |         Documents  data                                    |

   |01_shell/data/notes:                                        |
   |         TODO.txt                                           |
   |============================================================|


1.3 Danger Zone (3 points)
==========================


Describe what the command ``rm -rf /`` might do. Should you ever use
it? ::

	rm -rf /
	^   ^^ ^
	|   || +-- root directory / top level directory
	|   |+---- force (no prompts) 
	|   +----- recursive (until it reaches the end)
	+--- Remove command


- It will *recursively* (option ``-r``) delete *all* directories and
  all files and directories in these directories, starting from the
  root directory ``/``. With the "force" option (``-f``) it will also
  *not* prompt for any confirmations.
- I should never use this command (because it will likely leave my
  computer in a broken state and everything will be gone).

   
1.4 BONUS: Pipes and Filters (+5* points)
